# Use cases for S3 
- Back up and storage
- Disaster and recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- software delivery
- static website

# Amazon S3 bucket 
- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects in buckets
- Buckts must have unique name globally
- Buckets are defined in region level
Objects (files) have a key
the key is the full path of the object , the key is composed of prefix and object name
Max object size can be 5 tb
if uploading a file which is more than 5gb, we must use 'multi part upload'

# Amazon S3 security
- user based: IAM policies
- Resource based : Bucket policies , Object Access Control List , Bucket access control list
- Encryption

# Amazon S3 - Replication 
- must enable versioning
- cross region replication
- Same region Replication
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- copying is asynchronus
Use cases for replication -
  CRR : compliance lower latency acess , replication acrros accounts
  SRR: log aggregation, live replication between production and test

# S3 storage Classes
  - S3 standard - Gneral purpose : 99.99% availability, used for frquently access data, low latency and high throughput, sustain 2 concurrnt facilty failures, use cases are Big data analytics, mobile and gaming applicatioins, content distributions
  - Infrequent Access : for data that is less accessed but requires rapid access when needed, use cases are Disaster recovery , backups. less costly than stadard
  - One zone infreqent Access : High durability , data lost when AZ is destroyed, used for secondary back up copies of on premise data
  - Glacier storage clas : low cost cobject sorage meant for archiving or back up , price for storage + object retrival cost
  - glacuer instant retrieval : milisecond retrival , duration 90 days
  - Glacier flexible retrieval: Expedited (1 to 5 min) , standard ( 3 to 5 hours) bulk ( 5 to 12 hours) -free, duration 90 days
  - Glacier Deep Archive : satndard 12 hours, bulk 48 hours , duaration 180 days, low cost , for long term storage
