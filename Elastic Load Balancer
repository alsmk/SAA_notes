# Sticky Sessions
it is possible that implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
use case : Make sure that user doesn't lose their session data
Stickiness may imbalance the load of the load balancer
There can be two types cookies(mainly)
Application based cokiees(generated by target) and Duration based cookies(generated by load balancer)

# cross zone load balancing
with cross zone load balancing each load balancer instances distributes evenly across all registered instances in all AZ
without cross zone balancing requests are distributed in the instances of the node of the elastic load balancer
cross zone load balancing have no charges for ALB
if we use gateway load balancer and network load balancer it will have some charges

# SNI (server name indication)
SNI solves the problem of loading multiple ssl certificates onto web server (when one web server hosts multiple websites)
It's a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
It only works in ALB and NLB and cloudFront
